<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan is late this evening. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, very unusual for her. She is normally here before us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, it's twenty past six now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot: </font color="#0000FF">I hope she is ok.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> So how has everybody done this week?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">I have hardly written anything.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott: </font color="#0000FF">Nor have I.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">I feel bad because she tries so hard to make us creative but I have just been blank this week.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">Yes me too.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> I just can't think of an original idea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, I am the same. That's the tough bit isn't it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot:</font color="#0000FF"> Same with me. I sometimes thing every original story has already been written.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">(Laughing) Yes. I know it isn't true but I feel like that as well.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> All I keep getting into my head is some soppy love story. And all that has been done so many times before.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">I'd like to write a thriller but I just can't get the right inspiration.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> I am finding it difficult but I don't want to give up.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot:</font color="#0000FF"> I certainly don't want to give up. Ever since I was a kid I have wanted to be a writer.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">Yeh, me too.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris:</font color="#0000FF"> This is bad that none one of us has come up with an idea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> I hope Miss Brannigan won't be disappointed with us. She is so lovely.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> Even if one of us had an idea we could have kind of shared it. Put our own slant on it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot: </font color="#0000FF">Yes that would have worked.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">I guess we will all have to try extra hard next week.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">Easier said than done.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">I have even asked the people I work with if they have any ideas. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott: </font color="#0000FF">I did that too but it didn't work. One or two people offered suggestions but they weren't really workable.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">Sometimes I think I have a really good idea, then realised I have copied it from a book or movie.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">Yes that is so easy to do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> We wouldn't be the first though. I have read so many books and seen so many movies where the story has been very close to another.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes that's very true.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Elliott:</font color="#0000FF"> I actually find it quite easy to write the characters once I have the plot.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF">(laughing) I find that difficult too.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> I think it is easier than finding the plot.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">Definitely. The plot is definitely the hardest part.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">The hardest part will be telling Miss Brannigan that not one of us has had an idea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, I am not looking forward to that. I hate to disappoint her.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">She did say right at the beginning that she could not give us ideas, we had to think those out for ourselves.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> And she is right to do that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott:</font color="#0000FF"> She can help us make it sound better but we have to supply the idea in the first place.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">Exactly and we are failing miserably at that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> I am not going to give up though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> Not me. I am sure the creative juices will flow again.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">Like a river I hope.<p>
(they all laugh)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">I guess we all have a lot to learn which is why we are taking this class.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> And although we are all stumped at the moment, it's fun isn't it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes definitely, I am really enjoying it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot:</font color="#0000FF"> I think we all are.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Do you think she is coming this evening? She is awfully late.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris:</font color="#0000FF"> Shame we don't have a contact number for her.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> I do hope she is not unwell.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh I really hope not.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott:</font color="#0000FF"> I was just thinking. We shouldn't waste this time?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">What do you mean?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott:</font color="#0000FF"> Well, we are all sitting here complaining that we don't have any ideas. We could be using this time constructively.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> In what way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott:</font color="#0000FF"> Lets put our heads together and maybe between us we could come up with a good plot?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Hey! That's a great idea. And you are right, we are sitting here doing nothing when we could be productive.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, I can see how that might work.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris:</font color="#0000FF"> It will certainly give us something to do while we wait for Miss Brannigan.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot: </font color="#0000FF">Exactly. We have nothing to lose.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">So how shall e start this?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">I have an idea. How about we all think back to, well,  maybe, a funny incident in our lives, and if there is a really good one we'll use as a basis for a story. We can take it in turns.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot: </font color="#0000FF">Yes! I like it. Who goes first?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> I think Karen should go first as it was her idea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok I will. Let me Think<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris:</font color="#0000FF"> I hope I can remember something.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> Yeh, may not be all that easy.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, I've got something.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott:</font color="#0000FF"> Great, let's hear it then.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok. About 3 years ago I had parked my car in a supermarket carpark.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot: </font color="#0000FF">Which one, it could help with the story.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen. </font color="#0000FF">Yes, of course. It was waitrose.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> (laughing) Oh very posh, I have to go to Tesco's.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Me too normally. Anyway I have two big bags of shopping, and it is raining.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">Well, this is England.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> And I am trying to get my key from my coat pocket without dropping the shopping bags, and getting very wet.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Eventually I manage to dislodge the keys from my pocket but they fly out of my hand.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh no!So I have to put my  shopping bags down on the wet ground to search for the keys.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot:</font color="#0000FF"> Were the bags paper or plastic?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">Luckily they were plastic.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">One good thing then.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">Anyway, I can't see the keys anywhere, which is crazy because they couldn't have gone that far. I realized then what must have happened to them.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> What?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">When they flew out of my hands they must have gone under the car next to mine.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott: </font color="#0000FF">Oh! Bummer, and the ground is very wet I am guessing?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">You got it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">(Laughing) This is good.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">It wasn't at the time. So, only one thing for it, I have to get on my knees, in the wet and grovel under the car to try and find my keys.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh my gosh! Poor you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> So I kneel on the wet concrete, feel under the car and my fingers just reach the keys.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">So the day is saved.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">Well not quite. I try to open my door then realise it isn't even my car, just one that looks the same as mine.<p>
(all laughing).<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott:</font color="#0000FF"> Good story Karen. What does everyone think? Could we work with that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe</font color="#0000FF">: Well the thing is, That's Karen's story. Is it fair that we all use it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> (loudly) Oh! Miss Brannigan. Hello. We were worried about you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh no need to worry about me my dears. I am fine.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> That's good. We were a bit concerned.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">Let me sit myself down and apologise to you all for being so late.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">Everything is alright though isn't it Miss Brannigan.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, everything is fine thank you Karen. In fact couldn't be better.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">That's good to hear.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">You are usually here before us so that was whyworried a little.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">I do assure you everything is fine.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott.</font color="#0000FF"> That's a relief to all of us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">Thank you Elliott. It's knd of ypou to say that. Now, People how have you been getting on this week?<p>
(There is a short silence)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot: </font color="#0000FF">Actually Miss Brannigan, we haven't been getting on very well at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> I see and why is that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> We are all in the same boat: None of us can think of a good subject matter for a story.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">We just can't seem to get a good workable idea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">In my opinion Chris, almost any idea is workable if you take it in the right direction.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott: </font color="#0000FF">That is a thought worth hanging on to.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris:</font color="#0000FF"> we feel bad because we don't want to let you down. You have helped us ll so much the we really do want to produce something good.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">And I am confident you will.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">Well I admire your confidence in us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes so do I.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">I have something to tell you all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">(surprised) What is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott:</font color="#0000FF"> You are not leaving us are you Miss Brannigan?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> ( A little laugh) Oh no, nothing like that at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">Phew! That's a relief.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> How could I leave my darling little fledglings. My futer writers.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> So what is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss brannigan:</font color="#0000FF">It is a little confession actually.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">(Together) Chris, Karen, Elliot and Joe: </font color="#0000FF">A confession?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Branigan: </font color="#0000FF">Yes indeed. I confess that I have been the tiniest bit deceitful.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">In what way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot:</font color="#0000FF"> Ha I can't imagine you being deceitful.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Branigan:</font color="#0000FF"> Well I am afraid I have been.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> How?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">Well firstly I wasn't really late.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">Were you here before us then – and left?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">No, I was actually here a little later than normal but only by a few minutes. I wanted you to all be here and chatting before I arrived.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott: </font color="#0000FF">Which we were.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">So were where you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> ( another little laugh)I was right outside the door.<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Chris:</font color="#0000FF"> But why? What were you doing there?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> Listening to you all of course.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh dear so you heard out dilemma. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">I heard you all talking but I didn't spot any Dilemma.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris:</font color="#0000FF"> You must have heard. Our joint dilemma is that we don't have a decent idea for a story between us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> We really have tried but all failed miserably.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">I don't think you failed at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot:</font color="#0000FF"> But we have, and also we all felt we have let you down a bit.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> Not at all. Tell me have you all hear the expression 'Can't See The Wood For The Trees'?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe: </font color="#0000FF">Yes of course.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">I use it all the time.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF"></font color="#0000FF">Good, because that is your only problem.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">What do you mean?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> Over the last month or two you have all turned in some excellent work. You are all writers in the making.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> If only we could get ideas for plots.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> And that is why I sat outside the door today. You see many good stories begin with simple ideas and conversations. I wanted to help you with that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">I wish you had.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Branngan: </font color="#0000FF">Ah, but you see, I did.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">How?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> I wanted you to see how an idea can develop from almost any situation.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> Have I missed something here?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">You have indeed Joe.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliott: </font color="#0000FF">What did we miss then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">What you actually missed – was that you had a plot.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Did we?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes. A plot for a short story. And this is what I wanted to stress to you all. Plots don't have to be complicated, they can be quite simple situations.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot: </font color="#0000FF">Oh! My gosh! I think I get it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">Then please share it with the others Elliot and use this idea in the future.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> What is it Elliott? Tell us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes come on mate, spill the beans.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Elliot: </font color="#0000FF">We are the plot.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Chris: </font color="#0000FF">What?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh yes! I see it now too.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan:</font color="#0000FF"> What is it then Karen?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Karen: </font color="#0000FF">(Laughing) As Elliot said. We are the plot! Four people taking a creative writing class, 
                                        talking before the tutor arrives about not being able to think of a plot. That's the story!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Joe:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh yes of course!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Miss Brannigan: </font color="#0000FF">Well done, all of you. So here endeth today's lesson.<p>
